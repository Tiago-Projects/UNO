## Features

Each subfolder represents a specific feature or domain of the game. Example:

 - `card/` - Deals with the visualization and logic of UNO's cards.
 - `card-icon/` - Implements the Strategy Pattern for rendering different icons (e.g. Numbers, Skip, Draw-two, etc.)
 - `player-hand/` - Component responsible for displaying the player's hand

Objective: to keep each functionality isolated and apply the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
